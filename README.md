# 1. Why Do We Need Programming Languages?
  Programming languages are essential because they allow us to communicate with computers in a structured and understandable way. Since computers operate using binary code,              programming languages serve as an abstraction layer that lets us write complex logic in a human-readable format.
  They enable us to develop software, automate tasks, control hardware, and solve real-world problems efficiently. Whether it's building web applications, developing mobile apps, or     running machine learning models, programming languages provide the tools to implement and execute our ideas accurately.
  In short, programming languages are the foundation of modern technology and essential for driving innovation and automation in every industry.<br />
# 2. Can’t we communicate with a computer without using a programming language?
  Technically, we can communicate with a computer without using high-level programming languages — but it’s extremely difficult and inefficient.
  At its core, a computer understands only binary code (0s and 1s), also known as machine language. It is possible to write instructions directly in binary or in low-level assembly      language, but it's very error-prone, time-consuming, and hard to maintain.
  Programming languages were created to bridge the gap between human logic and machine instructions, making it easier to write, read, and manage code. They provide abstractions that     let us focus on solving problems without worrying about hardware-specific details.
  So, while it's possible in theory, in practice, programming languages are essential for effective and scalable communication with computers.
# 3. What are the differences between high-level and low-level programming languages?
The main difference lies in abstraction and closeness to hardware.
High-level programming languages like Python, Java, or JavaScript are designed to be easy for humans to read and write. They are more abstracted from hardware and come with features like memory management, built-in libraries, and portability across systems. <br />
Low-level languages like Assembly or C provide less abstraction and give more direct control over hardware, making them ideal for system programming, embedded systems, or performance-critical applications.
In short, high-level languages prioritize developer productivity and readability, while low-level languages offer better performance and control over system resources.
